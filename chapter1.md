This is the Context. It should help provide students with the background information needed.
The Instructions that follow should be in bullet point form with clear guidance for what is expected.

`@instructions`

- It should get students 50% of the way to the correct answer.
- So don't provide the answer, but don't just reiterate the instructions.
- Typically one hint per instruction is a sensible amount.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{r}
# Load datasets and packages here.
```

`@sample_code`
```{r}
# Your
# sample
# code
# should
# be
# ideally
# 10 lines or less,
# with a max
# of 16 lines.
```

`@solution`
```{r}
# Answer goes here
# Make sure to match the comments with your sample code
# to help students see the differences from solution

In this course, if you learn anything, I would be quite impressed, as it has been designed for me to learn the basics of DataCamp

`@instructions`
Create a variable named "x" that is a vector containing the three numbers: 2,3, and 7. Then, set a variable called "mean.x" to be the mean of this vector.

`@hint`
Assign a group of numbers  to a variable using c(â€¦)
The "mean()" function is useful for finding the mean of a vector

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{r}

```

`@sample_code`
```{r}
x=
mean.x=
```

`@solution`
```{r}
x=c(2,3,7)
mean.x=mean(x)
```

`@sct`
```{r}
%>% check_object("x") %>% check_equal()
%>% check_object("mean.x") %>% check_equal()
success_msg("Well done!")
```
